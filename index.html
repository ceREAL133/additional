        <b>Cucumber</b> (Cucumis sativus) is a widely-cultivated creeping vine plant in the Cucurbitaceae gourd family
        that
        bears
        cucumiform fruits, which are used as vegetables. There are three main varieties of cucumber—slicing,
        pickling,
        and burpless/seedless—within which several cultivars have been created. The cucumber originates from South Asia,
        but
        now grows on most continents, as many different types of cucumber are traded on the global market. In North
        America,
        the term wild cucumber refers to plants in the genera Echinocystis and Marah, though the two are not closely
        related.

<h2>Description</h2>
<hr>
<p>
    The cucumber is a creeping vine that roots in the ground and grows up trellises or other supporting frames, wrapping
    around supports with thin, spiraling tendrils. The plant may also root in a soilless medium, whereby it will
    sprawl along the ground in lieu of a supporting structure. The vine has large leaves that form a canopy over the
    fruits.

    The fruit of typical cultivars of cucumber is roughly cylindrical, but elongated with tapered ends, and may be as
    large as 62 centimeters (24 in) long and 10 centimeters (4 in) in diameter.

    Cucumber fruits consist of 95% water (see nutrition table). In botanical terms, the cucumber is classified as a
    pepo, a type of botanical berry with a hard outer rind and no internal divisions. However, much like tomatoes and
    squashes, it is often perceived, prepared, and eaten as a vegetable

    <p class="article1">Flowering and pollination</p>
    <p>
        A few cultivars of cucumber are parthenocarpic, the blossoms of which create seedless fruit without pollination,
        which degrades the eating quality of these cultivar. In the United States, these are usually grown in
        greenhouses, where bees are excluded. In Europe, they are grown outdoors in some regions, where bees are
        likewise excluded.

        Most cucumber cultivars, however, are seeded and require pollination. For this purpose, thousands of honey
        beehives are annually carried to cucumber fields just before bloom. Cucumbers may also be pollinated via
        bumblebees and several other bee species. Most cucumbers that require pollination are self-incompatible, thus
        requiring the pollen of another plant in order to form seeds and fruit. Some self-compatible cultivars exist
        that are related to the 'Lemon' cultivar. Symptoms of inadequate pollination include fruit abortion and
        misshapen fruit. Partially-pollinated flowers may develop fruit that are green and develop normally near the
        stem end, but are pale yellow and withered at the blossom end.

        Traditional cultivars produce male blossoms first, then female, in about equivalent numbers. Newer gynoecious
        hybrid cultivars produce almost all female blossoms. They may have a pollenizer cultivar interplanted, and the
        number of beehives per unit area is increased, but temperature changes induce male flowers even on these plants,
        which may be sufficient for pollination to occur.

    <p class="article">Nutrition, aroma, and taste</p>
    <p>
        In a 100-gram (3 1⁄2-ounce) serving, raw cucumber (with peel) is 95% water, provides 67 kilojoules (16
        kilocalories) of food energy, and supplies low content of essential nutrients, as it is notable only for vitamin
        K at 16% of the Daily Value (table).

        Depending on variety, cucumbers may have a mild melon aroma and flavor, in part resulting from unsaturated
        aldehydes, such as (E,Z)-nona-2,6-dienal, and the cis- and trans- isomers of 2-nonenal. The slightly bitter
        taste of cucumber rind results from cucurbitacins.

        In 2009, an international team of researchers announced they had sequenced the cucumber genome.

<h2>Varieties</h2>
<hr>
<span>In general cultivation, cucumbers are classified into three main cultivar groups: slicing, pickled, and seedless/burpless.</span>
<div class="varieties">
    <p class="article2">Slicing</p>
    <p>Cucumbers grown to eat fresh are called slicing cucumbers. The main varieties of slicers mature on vines with
        large leaves that provide shading. They are mainly eaten in the unripe green form, as the ripe yellow form
        normally becomes bitter and sour. Smaller slicing cucumbers can also be pickled.

        Slicers grown commercially for the North American market are generally longer, smoother, more uniform in color,
        and have much tougher skin. In contrast, those in other countries, often called European cucumbers, are smaller
        and have thinner, more delicate skin, often with fewer seeds, thus being sold in plastic skin for protection.
        This variety may also be called a telegraph cucumber, particularly in Australasia.</p>
</div>
<div class="varieties">
    <p class="article2">Pickling</p>
    <p>Pickling with brine, sugar, vinegar, and spices creates various flavored products from cucumbers and other
        foods. Although any cucumber can be pickled, commercial pickles are made from cucumbers specially bred for
        uniformity of length-to-diameter ratio and lack of voids in the flesh. Those cucumbers intended for pickling,
        called picklers, grow to about 7 to 10 cm (3 to 4 in) long and 2.5 cm (1 in) wide. Compared to slicers, picklers
        tend to be shorter, thicker, less-regularly shaped, and have bumpy skin with tiny white or black-dotted spines.
        Color can vary from creamy yellow to pale or dark green.</p>
</div>
<div class="varieties">
    <p class="article2">Gherkin</p>
    <p>Gherkins, also called cornichons, or baby pickles, are small cucumbers, typically those 2.5 to 12.5
        centimetres (1 to 5 in) in length, often with bumpy skin, which are typically used for pickling. The
        word gherkin comes from the early modern Dutch gurken or augurken ('small pickled cucumber'). The term is
        also used in the name for Cucumis anguria, the West Indian gherkin, a closely related species.</p>
</div>
<div class="varieties">
    <p class="article2">Burpless</p>
    <p>Burpless cucumbers are sweeter and have a thinner skin than other varieties of cucumber. They are reputed to be
        easy to digest and to have a pleasant taste. They can grow as long as 60 centimeters (2 ft), are nearly
        seedless, and have a delicate skin. Most commonly grown in greenhouses, these parthenocarpic cucumbers are often
        found in grocery markets, shrink-wrapped in plastic. They are marketed as either burpless or seedless, as the
        seeds and skin of other varieties of cucumbers are said to give some people gas.</p>
